# Learning-AWS-from-Scratch
從零開始學AWS Re：Learning AWS

👋 Hi, I’m @cheng-ruru

👀 I’m interested in cloud security, AWS, and community building, as well as cross-disciplinary learning in HR, finance, and accounting.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud security and AWS solutions, while also expanding my knowledge in HR, finance, and accounting.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cloud security projects, cross-disciplinary knowledge sharing, and professional development.

⚡ Fun fact: I went from being a cloud beginner to becoming an AWS Security Community Builder, while also learning across HR, finance, and accounting!
